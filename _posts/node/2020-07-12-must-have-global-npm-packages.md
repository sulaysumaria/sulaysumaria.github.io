Here is a list of packages that a NodeJS developer must have globally installed. (At least, I do)

```bash
npm i -g ngrok npm-check pm2 qrcode randomstring serve
```

- `ngrok` - Allows to expost a local port to the Internet, with https
- `npm-check` - Utility to check for outdated dependencies.
- `pm2` - Process manager for Node
- `qrcode` - Command line utility to generate qr codes from string. Can be useful in sharing some text from PC to Mobile
- `randomstring` - Generate random string directly from command line.
- `serve` - Make a local folder available on your local network.
