When you turn on your windows machine and start the ubuntu/bash(because you are a linux user but need to use Windows for some or other reason) in it and then you see this error code. You feel like "why Windows, why?".

This is what this error looks like:

```
Windows Subsystem for Linux has no installed distributions.
Distributions can be installed by visiting the Microsoft Store:
https://aka.ms/wslstore
Press any key to continue...
```

Well there is nothing to worry about. All your data is safe, even your ubuntu is also safe. You can start it up very easliy.

Here are the steps:

1. Open `cmd` as administrator.
2. Run following command: `net stop "LxssManager" & sc start "LxssManager"`
3. Start your ubuntu/bash again. Ready to go.

After running the above command, the output look like this:

```
C:\WINDOWS\system32>net stop "LxssManager" & sc start "LxssManager"
The LxssManager service is not started.

More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 3521.
